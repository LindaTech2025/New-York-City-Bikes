# ðŸš²NY Citi Bike 
This project was created as part of a short course completed with 'Career Foundry'. 

The study looks primarily at the use of rental bikes stationed across various locations in New York City by a company called Citi Bike. Citi Bike hosts one of the largest bike share programmes in the United States. It was designed to facilitate quick, fun, affordable trips in and around the City of New York. The service provides 20,000 bikes in over 1,300 pick up locations. Users are able to use this service via an app which allows them to pick up a bike at a nearby location and then deposit the bike at the end of their journey to the closest stand.

Citi Bike like most companies and organisations is looking to upgrade its business model, improve its services and provide increased value to its customers. It does this by collecting information regarding user demographics and user behaviour via the City Bike app. This information provides valuable insights which will be used in this study to achieve the following goals:
