# ðŸš²NY Citi Bike 
This project was created as part of a short course completed with 'Career Foundry'. 

The study looks primarily at the use of rental bikes stationed across various locations in New York City by a company called Citi Bike. Citi Bike hosts one of the largest bike share programmes in the United States. It was designed to facilitate quick and affordable trips in and across the City. The service provides 20,000 bikes in over 1,300 pick up locations. Users are able to use this service via an app which allows them to pick up a bike at one of the designated locations and deposit the bike at a nearby location at the end of their journey.

Citi bikes like most companies and organisations is looking to improve its services and provide increased value to its customers. It does this by collecting information regarding user demographics and user behaviour via the City Bike app. This information provides valuable insights into the following: Most popular pick-up locations, trip duration across different age groups and user behaviour across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers.)

# Questions Asked:
1.What are the most popular pick up locations across the city?

2.How does the average trip duration vary across the groups?

3.Which age group rents the most bikes?

4.How does bike rental vary across the two user groups on different days of the week?

5.Does user age impact the average trip duration?


# Problems Solved:
Which locations should have the most bike installations?

In what areas should further money be invested for the best results?

Which users groups should they tailor their marketing and advertising campaigns to?
