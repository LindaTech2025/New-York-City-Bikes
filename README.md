# ðŸš²New-York-City-Bike Rental
This project was created as part of a short course completed with 'The Career Foundry'. The study looks primarily at the use of rental bikes stationed acros various locations in New York City. It provides valuable insights into the most popular pick-up locations, trip duration across different age groups and  rental across the two user groups (one-time users vs long-term subscribers.)

# Problems Solved:
Which locations should have the most bike installations?

Which users have the longest trip duration and highest bike usage in order to target marketing campaigns more specifically at these groups?
